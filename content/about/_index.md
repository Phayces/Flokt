My name is Florentin Oktavian Hartl and I live in the cities of Vienna and Linz, Austria. The meaning of Flookt is me – quite literally. Thus, I care for every one of my works, aiming for the highest level of quality possible to satisfy my mind and, above all, to meet the expectations of everyone who supports Flookt.

I decided to share my designs with the world and to take my passion for 3D printing to the next level. I have a deep interest for Japan, minimalism and geometrical beauty, and I enjoy finding new ways of combining these three elements. The results range from Japanese cultural products in a reimagined fashion to simple, yet intricate trinkets of unique geometrical shapes.

The **crafting process** of Flookt jewellery starts with me creating a digital 3D model using a 3D modeling software. The finished model is then sent to *i.materialise*, a 3D printing service based in Belgium, who will create my design by printing a casting mould in the shape of the model and subsequently casting it with the corresponding metal. The resulting piece then undergoes a thorough polishing, turning it into a high-quality  piece of jewellery.

With the age of sixteen I started teaching myself digital 3D modelling and stuck to it ever since – leading to experimentations with 3D printing. I got quite fond of the process of imagining, designing and overturning, then *reimagining*, *redesigning* and eventually having a product to be proud of.
