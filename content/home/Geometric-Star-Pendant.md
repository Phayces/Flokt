This five-pointed star or asterisk pendant fits your neck with its canny simplicity and its genuine sense of style. 
<!--more-->

Each branch of the star is gradually elevated to the end, giving it a fair amount of three-dimensional detail. This pendant stands for style consciousness and original simplicity without being too basic.
