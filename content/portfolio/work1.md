This pendant is inspired by the unique look of a Japanese *gohei* (御幣). It is frequently encountered at Shintō Shrines throughout Japan and it is meant to have cleansing and sanctifying properties.
<!--more-->

The *gohei’s* characteristic shape has been carefully transferred into the pendant without losing its aesthetic recognition value. The minimalist and geometric simplicity of the pendant reflect its beauty and profound meaning in an elegantly humble way, just like a real *gohei* does.
