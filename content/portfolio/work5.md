A one-of-a-kind piece of jewellery that creates a touch of futurism with its peculiar Y-shape and its clear-cut indentations.
<!--more-->

The smooth base shape of the pendant is contrasted by the sharp-edged indentations in the centre, giving it the appeal of a modern accessory. First darkening by oxidation and then polishing thoroughly gives the deeper surfaces of the pendant a black colouring, while the upper surface becomes shiny.
